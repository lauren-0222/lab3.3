## What challenges did you face when refactoring your code to use Bootstrap?<br>
One challenge was translating custom CSS layouts into Bootstrap’s utility classes while maintaining the original design. Getting images to populate was not working. 
## How did using Bootstrap utility classes and components simplify your styling process?<br>
The pre-built card and grid components helped structure the layout quickly with minimal effort.
## In what scenarios might you choose not to use Bootstrap and write custom CSS instead?<br>
You might avoid Bootstrap when a design requires a unique look that doesn't align with Bootstrap’s built-in styles or when you want more control over performance and file size.
